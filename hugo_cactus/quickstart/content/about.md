# Oh, hi!

You seem to have stumbled upon my blog. Great! Now you might (or might not) be wondering who I am. Well, I'm just a regular dude that likes programming and stuff. I also like to write, hence the existence of this blog.

Apart from programming and writing, I also like to design stuff and make 3D models. Basically anything to do with computers and art. Music is also my thing, so I make some short tracks every now and then when I don't have anything better to do.

There are links to my other stuff down below, so feel free to check them out!
