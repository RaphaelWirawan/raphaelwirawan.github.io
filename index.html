<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 14px;"> I have always been very facinated by any sort of technology. Even when I was little, I would try to figure out how a dvd player works or try to figure out how a camera works. Now, my passion is coding and programming. I am currently studying C++, and some compliers like HTML and CSS. My dream is to work as a programmer in Silicon Valley in big companies such as Google. Until then, I will keep on practicing and hopefully I'll get better at programming.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; text-align:left;">I start getting facinated by programming and coding not so long ago. When I was around 13, I got to know some of my brother's friends. They were very good at programming and other technologies. So I often ask them questions about programming and making a website, which facinates me to learn about programming further. I also like video editing mostly with adobe premiere, and I'm also a little bit of a photographer enthusiast. I may not have a dslr camera, but I got my smartphone that can take photos I'm satisfied with. I like organizing something until it is aetheticly pleasing to the eye.</p>
