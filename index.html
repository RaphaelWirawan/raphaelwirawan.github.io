<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 14px;"> I have always been very facinated by any sort of technology.
	 Even when I was little, I would try to figure out how a dvd player works or try to figure out how a camera
	  works. Now, my passion is coding and programming. I am currently studying C++, and some compliers like HTML
	   and CSS.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; text-align:left;">I start getting facinated by programming and coding not so long ago.
	 When I was around 13, I got to know some of my brother's friends. They were very good at programming and other
	  technologies. So I often ask them questions about programming and making a website, which facinates me to
	   learn about programming further.</p>
